# Blackjack
A simple in-console Blackjack application to refresh C++ memory management and OOP skills. The User starts with $500 funds to play the game and can bet any amount within their funds. If the User uses all of their funds in one round and loses, that will then lead to going bankrupt which will result in a Gameover.
